# Read More Conditional in Summary

The `Read More...` link gets conditionally displayed in the `<YOUR_SITE>\layouts\default\list.html` file with a 
*conditional* clause. Also the &lt;!&#45;&#45;more&#45;&#45;> in each specific blog post contributes additionally to render the `Read More` text. 

This blog post intentionally gets ended here without any &lt;!&#45;&#45;more&#45;&#45;> to demonstrate the same. 


Cheers,\
RM...\

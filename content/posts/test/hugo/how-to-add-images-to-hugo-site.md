# How to Add Images to Hugo Site

You can add any static resources (like images) in the `static` directory of your hugo site, and
it can be referred with reference to the context root directly. 

<!--more-->

Example, I have added my profile pic (to be used elsewhere as well) named `Raghs.jpg` in the `static`
directory of my Hugo site, and it can be referred with my context root (host name) as 
`https://raghsonline.com/Raghs.jpg`. 

It is that simple :) 

## Actual Image for the reference 

<img src="https://raghsonline.com/Raghs.jpg" alt="Raghavan alias Saravanan Muthu"/>

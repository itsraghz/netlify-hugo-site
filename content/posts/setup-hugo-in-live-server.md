This post is a self remainder to help with the step by step execution of making a
Hugo Server live in a Prod Server for my own blogging.

The deployment can be made on any supporting server like _Go Daddy_, _Netlify_ or
_GitHub_ etc.,

<!--more-->

## Set up Hugo

Set up the Hugo Server locally with a good theme and do the necessary sanity of posts.

## Link Disqus - comments

Looks like Hugo has got an internal support for Disqus :)

- https://gohugo.io/content-management/comments/

## Security aspects if any

## Proper Config of paths and locations

## Deployment in Netlify or GitHub or GoDaddy

## Integration with other servers like dev.to or hashnode etc.,

Cheers,\

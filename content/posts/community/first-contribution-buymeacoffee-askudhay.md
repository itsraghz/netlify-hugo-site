I just made my first contribution to the Open Source Community - *AngularHive* run by my good friend *UdhayaKumar Govindarajan* via who ran a fundraising campaign for running the Angular Meetups via meetup.com website.

Feeling very happy because of two reasons. 

1. Have  been able to my best part to the community. 
2. Started with my good friend who is really deserving and passionate on promoting Angular :)

I just made my first contribution to the Open Source Community - *AngularHive* run by my good friend *UdhayaKumar Govindarajan* via who is running a fundraising campaign for running the Angular Meetups via [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/angular-hive/) website.

Feeling very happy because of two reasons. 

1. Have  been able to my best part to the community. 
2. Started with my good friend who is really deserving and passionate on promoting Angular :) 

# Further Steps 

> He still has a long way to go, as so far ONLY *21% of 120 USD* has been raised.

I just bought the Rieckpil's Testing Springboot Masterclass Video Course today.

After a long thought and going through the reviews, I have carefully decided to purchase a Video Course by *rieckpil.de* (Philip) - [*Testing Spring Boot MasterClass*](https://rieckpil.de/testing-spring-boot-applications-masterclass/?utm_source=RIECKPIL+Newsletter&utm_campaign=8f8c5cf9dc-RIECKPIL_NEWSLETTER_TSBAM_BIRTHDAY&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_d60be7e492-8f8c5cf9dc-446138422&mc_cid=8f8c5cf9dc&mc_eid=dfb0357bad#FreeLessons) - where he had offerred 30% discount on the courses on account of the 1st Birthday of this course, along side he offers two bonuses for absolutely free.

* [Testing Tools and Libraries - eBook](https://rieckpil.de/testing-tools-and-libraries-every-java-developer-must-know/)

 I am really excited to start the journey with the Testing of SpringBoot Applications. I will also be sharing my updates as I progress the course, which will be a self notes and a review of this course. 

 Stay tuned :)

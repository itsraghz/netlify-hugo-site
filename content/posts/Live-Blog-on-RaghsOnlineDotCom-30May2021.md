# Made my website up and running with Hugo blog

Finally after some good amount of learning, exploring and troubleshooting, I made the *Hugo* based blogs
to my live domain - [RaghsOnline.com](raghsonline.com) today :)

Will share a detailed posting later on the learnings, for my own reference as well. 

<!--more-->

I had transferred the nameserver for my domain from *GoDaddy* to the Netlify servers so that the [site being uploaded
in Netlify](https://raghsonline.netlify.app/) will be redirected to the custom domain [RaghsOnline](http://www.raghsOnline.com)

## Links 

The links that were helpful are given below. 

* https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/netlify-dns/dns-records/
* https://answers.netlify.com/t/support-guide-finding-the-ip-addresses-for-netlifys-nameservers/8366
* https://in.godaddy.com/help/change-nameservers-for-my-domains-664


## Todo 

 * Security Certificates via [LetsEncrypt](http://letsencrypt.com)
 * Proper domain set up - may be a subdomain of *blog* as [http://blog.raghsonline.com](http://blog.raghsonline.com) OR [http://raghsonline.com/blog](http://raghsonline.com/blog)
 * Migration of old blog posts from different sources :) 
 * Few other security measures if any.

Cheers,\

# Intellij Idea Value Add Highlighting Values Used

We will see a great value add in the *IntellijIDEA* - the famous IDE for Java Applications. 

<!--more-->

# Problem 
If we are working on a set/list of values in an iteration/loop one at a time, but the values are not having any finite pattern, most likely we might get lost or could possibly overlook the values - which can potentially result in a typo or miss! 

# Solution 

What if the values you had used is highlighted when you press the `Ctrl + Tab` key, to get the list of values? :) That is exactly the help and the value-add given by the Intellij IDEA. 

It highlights the used values in Red color, and the unused ones with the white color. Of course, you could customize the colors if you want, but I haven't made any!

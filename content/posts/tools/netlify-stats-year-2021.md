## Try Yours 

If you are active user on Netlify, and you want to check your stats, check this URL [Your-Year-on.netlify.com](https://your-year-on.netlify.com/). It prepares you with some interactive Qns with the terminal like interface in the browser, and lets you login to your Netlify account - for asking your consent on each Q.

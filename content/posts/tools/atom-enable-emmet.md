In this blog post, we will see how to enable the *Emmet* Plugin to generate the HTML code snippets easily. 

<!--more-->

# Emmet Plugin 

The *Emmet* Plugin is very famous and useful tool that is pluggable with most of the text editors and IDEs for the snippet generation, like the barebone boilerplate code for *HTML*, and other Programming Langauges like *Java* etc., where you need 
some basic code to start with and you would not feel like typing everything from the scratch adds fun after sometime :) 

# Install in Atom.io 

Installing a plugin is very easy in the Atom editor, as you can follow any of the following two.

1. Search for a package inside the Atom Editor itself. `Settings` &rarr; `Package`.

2. Use `Ctrl + Shift + P` to invoke the *Install Package* option inside the Atom.io editor.

   It takes you to the same `Settings` &rarr; `Package` screen. You can search for a particular package and click on `Install`.

*Note*: 

1. If the package is installed already, you get the buttons to `Uninstall` and `Disable`. 
2. If the package is not yet installed, you get the button `install` to install in the local machine/atom editor.

# Enbale in Atom.io 

Please make sure that you *restart* the Atom IDE after you install the Emmet Plugin. 

Even afterwards if it still does not work, you must not have chosen/specified the file type for the Atom editor to realize the semantics. For which you can either do a `Save As` OR press `Ctrl + Shift + L` (for Windows) to enable the *File Type*, with which Atom.

 You should get the boilerplate code now filled with a keystroke :)

 You see that a green color arrow mark enabled on the `html` line you typed, and you see the syntax enabled - all in caps with the right hand side -`HTML` in the screenshot. Press `Enter` key there and you get the full HTML5 skeleton in a fraction of a second :)

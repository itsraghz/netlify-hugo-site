# Draw.io Extension inside VSCode

We now have a simple and an easy way to draw diagarams in your favorite editor - Visual Studio Code (VScode).

<!--more-->

## Extension 

Visit this [link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio) to get the extension installed in vscode.  

The preferred option is to click on the `install` button which automatically opens up the `vscode` editor installed in your machine and takes you to the extension and let you click on the `install` at one click.

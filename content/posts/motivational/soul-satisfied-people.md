# Soul Satisfied People

I was waiting at the bus stand to go to my hometown. The bus had not yet arrived at the bus stand.

I was sitting there reading a book.

Seeing me, a girl of about 10 years of age came to me and said, "Sir, please buy these pens, I will give you four pens for Rs.10. I am very hungry, I will get to eat something."

<!--more-->

There was a little boy with her too, maybe her brother.

I said, "Well I don't need a pen."

Her next question was very sweet, "Then how will we eat something?"

I said, "I don't want a pen, but you will definitely eat something."

I had two packets of biscuits in my bag. I took out both the packets, and handed one to each of them. But I was surprised beyond limit when she returned one packet and said, "Sir ji! One is enough, we will share it."

I was utterly surprised to hear this!

I said again, "It's okay, you keep both. It doesn't matter."

That girl's reply shook me to my core, my soul. She said, *"Then what will you eat?"*

In this world, where people earning crores of billions keep humanity aside and rob people wildly in the name of success, a hungry girl taught me the ultimate lesson of humanity.

I said to myself, this is what soul-satisfied people look like... _Don't take so much from someone out of greed that we eat their share as well_..!!

> "There is a fundamental principle- *give more than take*. These qualities are manifested in a person who has grown through spiritual practice and self-study."

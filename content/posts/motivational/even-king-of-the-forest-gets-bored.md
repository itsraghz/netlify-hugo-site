# Even King of the Forest Gets Bored

Once a Monkey wished to die due to sadness, he pulled the ears of a sleeping Lion. 

The Lion woke up and roared with anger: "Who did this? Who has invited his death?"

Monkey : "I did Maharaj. I am very much depressed due to lack of friends and I want to die, why don't you kill me."

<!--more-->

The Lion asked with a laugh: "Did anyone see you while pulling my ears?"

Monkey : "No, Chief!"

Lion : "Okay, pull my ears a few more times, _it feels very good_."😀

*Essence of this Story*

By Living Alone, _even the *King of the Forest* gets bored_. So Stay in touch with your *friends*. 
Keep pulling their Ears, Legs, Dragging, Blabbering, Laughing. _Don't be Dull_. 

Keep having Fun. Keep in touch with your Old Friends.  \

👍👍👍👍

# How to View Hidden Files in Finder

## Hidden Files 

Any files that has a `.` as a prefix is called as a *Hidden* file, and it is usually preferred for the internal structure of the tools/applications.

By default, the hidden files will not be displayed in the *Finder*, similar to the *Explorer* in the Windows OS. 

## Showing hidden files via Mac Finder

Press the `“Command” + “Shift” + “.” (period)` keys at the same time. 

The hidden files will show up as translucent in the folder. 

If you want to obscure the files again, press the same `“Command” + “Shift” + “.” (period)` combination, it will simply _toggle_ the settings to show/hide the hidden files.
